# Diabetes-Prediction -Project
<h1>Goal of our project:</h1>
<p>Our goal is to predict a particular person is diabetic or not based on the given data.
Which will be useful in future also.</p>
<br><br>
<ol>The steps are as follows:
<li>Collecting data</li>
<li>Use parameters </li>
<li>Data pre-processing (helping us which model to use)</li>
<li>Random Forest is efficient algorithm for diabetes prediction.</li>
<li>Train and test</li>
<li>Predict</li></ol>
<p>Usage of Random Forest in this project.</p>
<p>Ordinal encoding for input parameters.</p>
<p>Feature scaling will help in calculating the gradient descent and will help in cost function analysis too.<p>
<p>Next step was to too collect more data as it will solve real world problem and not technical only. It will also give more parametres for diabetes prediction </p>
<p>Merging collected data to previous data and handled missing values.</p>
<p>Plotting histograms and eliminating features based on that graph.</p>

<h2>Changes we are going to make in the project are as follows:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Merging more than one column of datasets for more accuracy.</li>
  <li>Then again drop out some features and test the code.</li>
  <li>The code uploaded right now has 99.66% efficiency (more features dropped out).</li>
  <li>So introducing more features again.</li>
</ol>
