# Diabetes-Prediction -Project
<h1>Goal of our project:</h1>
<p>Our goal is to predict a particular person is diabetic or not based on the given data.
Which will be useful in future also.</p>
<br><br>
<ol>The steps are as follows:
<li>Use parameters </li>
<li>Data pre-processing (helping us which model to use)</li>
<li>Regularization of dataset</li>
<li>Find costfunction</li>
<li>Train and test</li>
<li>Predict</li></ol>
<p>Usage of Random Forest this project.</p>
<p>Ordinal encoding for input parameters.</p>
<p>Feature scaling will help in calculating the gradient descent and will help in cost function analysis too.<p>
<p>Our next step was to too collect more data as it will solve real world problem and not technical only.</p>
<p>Merged our collected data to previous data and handled missing values</p>
