# Diabetes-Prediction -Project
<h1>Goal of our project:</h1>
<p>Our goal is to predict a particular person is diabetic or not based on the given data in the csv file.
Which will be useful in future also.</p>
<hr><hr>
The steps are as follows:
1. Use parameters 
2. Regularization of dataset
3. Find costfunction
4. Predict
<p>We are going to use logistic regression in this project.</p>
<p>We did complete ordinal encoding.</p>
<p>Till now we have used feature scaling using mean normalization method so that it will help us in gradient descent and cost function analysis too.<p>
