# Diabetes-Prediction -Project
<h1>Goal of our project:</h1>
<p>Our goal is to predict a particular person is diabetic or not based on the given data in the csv file.
Which will be useful in future also.</p>
<br><br>
<ol>The steps are as follows:
<li>1. Use parameters </li>
<li>2. Regularization of dataset</li>
<li>3. Find costfunction</li>
<li>4. Predict</li></ol>
<p>We are going to use logistic regression in this project.</p>
<p>We did complete ordinal encoding.</p>
<p>Till now we have used feature scaling using mean normalization method so that it will help us in gradient descent and cost function analysis too.<p>
