# Diabetes-Prediction -Project
<h1>Goal of our project:</h1>
<p>Our goal is to predict a particular person is diabetic or not based on the given data.
Which will be useful in future also.</p>
<br><br>
<ol>The steps are as follows:
<li>Collecting data</li>
<li>Use multiple parameters </li>
<li>Data pre-processing (helping us which model to use)</li>
<li>Random Forest is efficient algorithm for diabetes prediction.</li>
<li>Train and test</li>
<li>Predict</li></ol>
<p>Usage of Random Forest in this project.</p>
<p>Collect more data as it will solve real world problem and not technical only. It will also give more parametres for diabetes prediction </p>
<p>Merging collected data to previous data and handled missing values.</p>
<p>Plotting histograms and eliminating features based on that graph.</p>

<h2>Key points for prediction of outcome</h2>
<h3>Handling data properly</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use features which the user understands.</li>
  <li>Merging column of dataset for more accuracy and new parameters introduced.</li>
  <li>Then again drop out some features and test the code.</li>
  <li>If you drop out relevant data and accuracy is high -> no point cause relevant data is vanished.</li>
  <li>Drop out features statistically.</li>
  <li>Search for best fit parameters in the model(RandomForest in this case)</li>
</ol>
